# ML-Pong

Project Definition:
Goal: Create a machine learning model that can learn to play the game of Pong, then apply predictive analysis to anticipate the model's performance as it trains.

Success Criteria:
Proficiency: The ML model should be able to play Pong competently.
Predictive Accuracy: The predictive analysis should be reasonably accurate in forecasting the model's progress.
Stages of the Project:
Environment Setup and Preliminary Research:

Set up the development environment.
Familiarize yourself with the Pong game mechanics.
Understand the basics of reinforcement learning and its application.
Game Development:

Implement or leverage an existing Pong game.
Establish the rules, rewards, and penalties for the AI player.
Reinforcement Learning Implementation:

Develop the AI model.
Train the AI model using the game environment.
Periodically evaluate and save the AI's performance metrics.
Predictive Analysis:

Use the collected metrics to build a linear regression model.
Predict the AI's performance trajectory.
Visualization & Reporting:

Visualize the AI's progress and the regression predictions.
Document findings, challenges, and future improvements.
Refinement & Optimization:

Iterate on the model to improve its gameplay.
Fine-tune the regression model for better predictive accuracy.
Presentation & Demonstration:

Showcase the working AI model.
Present the predictive analysis and insights derived.
Evaluation:
At the end of each stage, it would be beneficial to have a checkpoint. Check the objectives of that phase, ensuring you're on track and haven't missed any key elements. Reiterate and refine based on feedback or new insights.

This high-level breakdown gives you a roadmap. Each stage can be expanded into detailed tasks and milestones as you proceed. Remember, the process is iterative; based on results and challenges, you might need to revisit and modify earlier stages.
